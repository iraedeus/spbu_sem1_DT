## Homeworks
1. - ``calculate_polynomial.py`` - Calculating a polynomial $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x$ using two multiplication operations.
   - ``vectors_and_matrix.py`` - Functions for performing operations on vectors and matrices.
   - ``bash_imitate.py`` - Simulation of the wc, head and tail bash commands.  
&ndsp;
2. - ``dna.py`` - A program that restores the original appearance of the string by logs.
   - ``text_analysis.py`` - Counts the number of each word in a punctuation-free and lemmatized text.  
&ndsp;
3. - ``carry.py`` - Implementation of currying using the function ``carry_explicit ``.  
&ndsp;
4. - The ``queue`` module contains an implementation of the Abstract Data Type - Queue.
   - ``binary_calculator.py`` - Summing two numbers in binary representation without using built-in solutions.
   - ``exp_normalized_format.py`` - Output of numbers in exponential normalized form.  
&ndsp;
5. - ``avl_tree.py``- contains an implementation of the ATD - AVL tree.
   - The ``shop`` module contains an example of using an AVL tree on the example of a store.  
&ndsp;
6. - ``utf16_encoder.py`` - converts each character of the string to utf16 format.  
&ndsp;
7. - ``re_checker.py`` - checks whether the string belongs to the languages described by regular expressions: 
     1) ``(a|b)*abb``
     2) ``digit+(.digit+)?(E(+|-)?digit+)?``
---
## Practicies
1. - ``incomplete_quotient.py`` - finding an incomplete quotient of a number I use only the minus, plus and multiplication operations.
   - ``prime_nums.py`` - outputs all prime numbers that do not exceed the selected number $n$.
   - ``swap_parts.py`` - swaps two pieces of the array without creating a new one.  
&ndsp;
2. - ``bulls_and_cows.py`` - the implementation of the game bulls and cows with a computer.
   - ``fractional_finder`` - outputs in ascending order all simple irreducible fractions enclosed between 0 and 1, whose denominators do not exceed $n$.  
&ndsp;
3. - ``stack.py`` -implements the data structure - stack.  
&ndsp;
4. - ``quadratic.py`` - solves the quadratic equation and catching all the errors.  
&ndsp;
5. - ``bst.py`` - implements the data structure - BST (Binary Search Tree).  
&ndsp;
6. - ``hash_table.py`` -  implements the data structure - Hash Table. 
&ndsp;
7. - ``fsm.py`` - implements the data structure - FSM (Finite State Machine).

## Test works

1. - ``deque`` - implements the data structure - Deque.
   - ``letter_counter.py`` - counts the number of each letter encountered in the transferred file.  
&ndsp;
2. - ``fibb.py`` - calculates the n-th fibonacci number.
   - ``test_safe_call`` - a decorator that, when an error is raised, does not stop the program, but outputs a warning to the console.  
&ndsp;
3. - ``sprite_generator.py`` - a console application that generates a random symmetric sprite of size $n$ by $n$.
